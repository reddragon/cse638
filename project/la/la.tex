In this paper, we present a simple $O\mathrm{<}n, \log{n}\mathrm{>}$
approach to solving the \textit{Level Ancestor Problem}.

\section{Level Ancestor Problem}
Do a Euler Tour of the tree, and label the nodes in increasing order of their
first appearance in the Euler Tour. We maintain a vector for each level in the 
tree, and as and when we see nodes for the first time, we insert them into their
labels into the respective vectors (as per the level of the node). It is easy
to see that the labels in each vector would be in increasing order.

Now, if we wish to answer the $l$-th Level Ancestor query for a node labelled $n$,
we can index into the vector for the $l$-th level, and binary search for the 
greatest label in the vector, which is smaller than $n$. The reason why this 
works is that the ancestor at level $l$ would have been visited before the node 
labelled $n$, and hence have a smaller label. Any other node on level $l$ would have
either been visited before the correct ancestor, or after the node $n$. Using
Binary Search, we can thus answer the Level Ancestor query in $O(\log{n})$ time, 
with $O(n)$ extra space but without any preprocessing. 

Using the fast binary search we described earlier, we can improve the running 
time to $O((\log{\log{n}})^3)$ (FIXME) time, without increasing the extra space
requirement asymptotically.
